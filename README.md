# Coronavirus Daily Tracker

Website built in React to track daily coronavirus reported cases and deaths by country, via global heat map
and individual country time charts

Most data on coronavirus has one or more of the following characteristics:
- Lacks reputable, verifiable data sources
- Has data visualizations that are static images - you can't interact with them!
- User experience is poor, clunky or overloaded

This website was made with a few specific goals:
- Rely on a reputable data source, one that users can easily verify for themselves
- Have simple but sleek data visualizations
- Present a minimal, focused user experience
